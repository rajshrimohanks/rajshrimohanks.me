Hi. I'm Rajshri Mohan. I build software for a living.

I currently work with [IQZ Systems][iqz-systems] here in [Coimbatore, India][coimbatore] as an Enterprise Architect. It's a lot of fun and I get to learn a lot.

I was born and brought up in Coimbatore, so it's no surprise that I love this place. It's also an amazing city to live in â€” not too big, not too small. Do visit sometime and you won't regret it. :)

I love coffee and I'm always up for a nice talk and food. Drop me a message in social media if you'd like to meet up.

Have a good day!

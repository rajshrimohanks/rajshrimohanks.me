Vanakkam! Namaste! Hi! I'm Rajshri Mohan. I was named Sujay when I was younger but for some reason, my parents changed it later on. I like both, although I wish more people called me Sujay. :smile:

I work as a Software Developer at [IQZ Systems](http://www.iqzsystems.com/). And when I'm not coding or thinking about software designs, I'm usually playing Battlefield 4 online or reading some nice fiction lying on my bed. Sometimes I also like to sit and stare at things and dream about a world filled with love and happiness.

I like to drive my car - a 2014 Alto K10\. It's tiny for a 6-footer like me but it suffices. And when inside it, driving along listening to some lovely A R Rahman or Linkin Park or One Republic, I feel happy and elated. Inside a car, one can find a world of their own - secluded from the busy and harsh world of outside by glass windows. _It's quite like meditation, this driving thing, don't you think?_

On occasions, I like to indulge in whimsical pleasures like buying soft plushy toys, building Lego kits or just buying up a lot of chocolates and eating them to my heart's content. And at other times, I can get pretty sarcastic. My friends tell me that I'm good at it. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

And that's it about me.

Thanks for reading this bit about me. Now go have a lovely day for yourselves! :innocent:

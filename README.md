## Syntax Highlighting

[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) is required for syntax highlighting to work. Install using Python's pip like so: `pip install Pygments`. (Make sure Pygments is in the `PATH` for Hugo to find.) In Ubuntu based systems, it can also be installed via apt: `sudo apt-get install python3-pygments`. More details available [here](https://gohugo.io/extras/highlighting/).
